I am currently a Ph.D student in [Pangu Lab](https://pangukaitian.github.io/pangu/?lg=en&tab=home), Kyushu University, Japan. 
I am advised by [Prof.Jianjun Zhao](http://stap.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~zhao/). 
I am also advised by [Prof.Lei Ma](https://malei.xyz/) and [Prof.Xiaofei Xie](https://xiaofeixie.bitbucket.io/). 
Prior to becoming a Ph.D. candidate, I received my B.S. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2015 and my M.S. degree in Engineering from Kyushu University in 2022.

## Research Interests

My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Security and Privacy. Currently I focus on the performance, efficiency, security and reliability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. I would be happy to discuss and collaborate with researchers interested in the above topics.
