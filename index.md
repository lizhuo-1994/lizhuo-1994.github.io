# About Me




Currently a Ph.D. student in [**Pangu Lab**](https://pangukaitian.github.io/pangu/?lg=en&tab=home), Kyushu University, Japan. My advisor is [**Prof.Jianjun Zhao**](http://stap.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~zhao/). Prior to becoming a Ph.D. candidate, I received my B.Eng. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2015 and my M.Eng. degree in Engineering at Kyushu University in 2022.

## Research Interests

My research is mainly about Reinforcement Learning (RL), including the algorithm sample efficiency, reliability, security, privacy, and corresponding applications. I am glad to discuss and collaborate with researchers interested to the above topics.
